# Art Prompt Challenge
Website, where you can roll virtual dices to get inspiration for "creating whatever you want (but you want too much)". Original idea by Polyfjord[^1]. 

## How about to create...
Surely you've had a situation where you had no ideas for an artwork. 
Or you wanted to have fun by challenging yourself to create something on a random theme. 
And there it is, the solution!

Want to create something like ***wild** **aquamarine** colored **toy** in **ancient** world, created with **pixelated/voxelated** art style ruleset*? 
No problem! 
Roll the virtual dice and get a really random[^2] artwork prompt, not forgetting to try to implement it.

By default you can generate place, what you'll draw or render, accent color, art style and etc.

You're also able to create your own generator and share it with others.
