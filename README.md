# Art Prompt Challenge
Website, where you can roll virtual dices to get inspiration for "creating whatever you want (if you want too much)". Original idea by [Polyfjord](https://youtube.com/c/Polyfjord)[^1]. 

## How about to create...
Surely you've had a situation where you had no ideas for an artwork. 
Or you wanted to have fun by challenging yourself to create something on a random theme. 
And there it is, the solution!

Want to create something like ***wild** **aquamarine** colored **toy** in **ancient** world, created with **pixelated/voxelated** art style ruleset*? 
No problem! 
Roll the virtual dice and get a random[^2] artwork prompt, not forgetting to try to implement it.

By default you can generate place, what you'll draw or render, accent color, art style and etc.

You're also able to create your own generator and share it with others.

## How to use

Just open [artpromptchallenge.net](https://artpromptchallenge.net) in browser that supports JS and WebGL.

Click on "Generate" button and after couple of seconds you'll get your prompt.

If you want to share result of your artwork, you need to create free account[^5].

Account also required if you want to create own prompt generator.

`Art Prompt Challenge` website support OAuth2 integrations with YouTube (Google), Discord, BÄ“hance, Vimeo, Imgur.
